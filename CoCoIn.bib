abstract = {Many of life’s most fascinating phenomena emerge from interactions among many elements—many amino acids determine the structure of a single protein, many genes determine the fate of a cell, many neurons are involved in shaping our thoughts and memories. Physicists have long hoped that these collective behaviors could be described using the ideas and methods of statistical mechanics. In the past few years, new, larger scale experiments have made it possible to construct statistical mechanics models of biological systems directly from real data. We review the surprising successes of this “inverse” approach, using examples from families of proteins, networks of neurons, and flocks of birds. Remarkably, in all these cases the models that emerge from the data are poised near a very special point in their parameter space—a critical point. This suggests there may be some deeper theoretical principle behind the behavior of these diverse systems.},

abstract = {Interactions are ubiquitous and have been extensively studied in many ecological, evolutionary, and physiological systems. A variety of measures—ANOVA, covariance, epistatic additivity, mutual information, joint cumulants, Bliss independence—exist that compute interactions across fields. However, these are not discussed and derived within a single, general framework. This missing framework likely contributes to the confusion about proper formulations and interpretations of higher-order interactions. Intriguingly, despite higher-order interactions having received little attention, they have been recently discovered to be highly prevalent and to likely impact the dynamics of complex biological systems. Here, we introduce a single, explicit mathematical framework that simultaneously encompasses all of these measures of pairwise interactions. The generality and simplicity of this framework allows us to establish a rigorous method for deriving higher-order interaction measures based on any of the pairwise interactions listed above. These generalized higher-order interaction measures enable the exploration of emergent phenomena across systems such as multiple predator effects, gene epistasis, and environmental stressors. These results provide a mechanistic basis to better account for how interactions affect biological systems. Our theoretical advance provides a foundation for understanding multi-component interactions in complex systems such as evolving populations within ecosystems or communities.},
